Source code for robots used in Team MixedUp's presentation on Destination Imagination Poland 2018. We got second place btw.
This repository is an unmantained mess of Polish and English bad code. Do not touch.
## Compiling
You're going to need the following libraries:
* [Adafruit PWM Servo Driver](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)
* [IRremote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)
* [Arduino USB Host Shield 2.0](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0)
Now you can just run each .ino file in subfolders and compile them with Arduino IDE.
